        // We are given a bar of chocolate composed mxn square pieces.
        // One Should break the chocolate into single squares. Each break of a part of the
        // cocolate is charged a cost expressed by a positive integer.
        // This cost does not depend on the size of the part that is being broken but only depends
        // on the line the break goes along. Let us denote the costs of breaking along consecutive
        // vertical lines with x1,x2,...,xm-1 and along horizontal lines with y1,y2,...,yn-1.
        // compute the minimal cost of breaking the whole chocolate into single squares.
